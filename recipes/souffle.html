        <h1>"The only cheese souffle recipe you need."</h1>

        <p> Whether a simple cheese version or something fancier involving lobster or asparagus, soufflés are the pinnacle of egg dishes. Nevertheless, a lot of people are intimidated by soufflés; there seems to be something arcane or magical about creating them, but in fact, they're not difficult to make with some practice.

            This is a basic, easy cheese soufflé recipe that can be adapted in many ways. If this is your first time making a soufflé, read through the instructions and prep all of your ingredients before starting. Follow the recipe carefully, then you can try mixing in other ingredients and putting your spin on the recipe for future meals.
        
            A successful cheese soufflé is light, airy, and delicately savory. The whipped, folded-in egg whites give the soufflé its unique, fluffy texture. Serve cheese soufflé with roasted meat like beef, ham, or lamb, and a crisp green salad or vegetable on the side.

        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps:</h1>


        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Brush butter on the bottom and up the sides of two 5 1/2-ounce ramekins. Scoop in some sugar; rotate ramekins to coat while pouring most of the sugar back into its container. Place ramekins on a shallow baking pan.</li>
            <li>Separate eggs between 2 bowls. Add sugar, flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, vanilla extract, lemon zest, cream cheese, and Cheddar cheese to the yolks. Mix the souffle base with a spatula until sugar and flour disappear.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the room-temperature egg whites. Beat with a whisk until soft peaks form; peaks should hold their shape but not be stiff or dry. Stir and fold 1/2 of the egg whites into the souffle base until combined. Gently fold the rest of the egg whites into the batter.</li>
            <li>Fill ramekins up to the lip with the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and browned, about 12 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
