        <h1>"The perfectly accurate ratatouille like the movie."</h1>

        <p>
            Not just a lovable cartoon about a friendly rat, ratatouille is also one of France’s most iconic dishes. From Provence, the dish sees vegetables shallow-fried and then layered in a casserole dish before being baked in an oven. French chefs have been debating whether the vegetables need cooking beforehand for centuries, but however you prepare it, the results are still great. This traditional peasant dish can be a side dish, appetizer, or a main course, and tastes great with red wine and fresh, crusty bread. A similar Basque dish is pipérade, which typically adds ham and sometimes eggs to the stewed vegetable mix.

            <li>Spread tomato paste into the bottom of a 10x10-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with onion and garlic and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil and water until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper, starting at the outer edge of the dish and working concentrically towards the center.
