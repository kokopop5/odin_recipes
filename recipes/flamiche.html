        <h1>"Easiest professional level flamiche recipe."</h1>

        <p>If you love French dishes, tarts should definitely be on your list of things to master! After all, nobody makes tarts like the French! Actually, scratch that. Nobody makes any pastry like the French!

            I especially love this recipe because, despite the fancy name, it is easy and versatile. It can be served both as an appetizer and as a main dish, accompanied by a green salad.
            
            And while I like mine warm, it is often served at room temperature, so you can make it ahead of time if you want!</p>
